# Fabric AutoBookLib

Just move the last release and fabric api to /mods folder

## Usage

Default hotkey is J and default targeted enchantment is mending. Pressing J looking at a villager or lectern will target it, and pressing J looking at any other block will start the search.

Video tutorial: [How to get any tradable enchant you want on Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr1QyvVZX44)

The video tutorial is for the gui version, now you can open a gui to target enchantments pressing "K". You can select multiple enchantments to search, and set the max price of the enchantment. Any targeted enchantment found will stop the process.
